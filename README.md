# PDF Merger

This is a compact tool which allows you to merge your pdf files resulting in one final document.

It is written in **Python 3** and uses Python's **tkinter** for the GUI realization. 

## Requirements

The **PyPDF2 library** needs to be installed beforehand.
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install **PyPDF2**.

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```

## Usage

Open your cmd and navigate to the folder where *pdfmerger.py* is. Now simply type:

```bash
python pdfmerger.py
```

The GUI will open up and you can start merging your files.
